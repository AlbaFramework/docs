# Getting Started

This section will help you to set up a new Alba project.
You must [install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) if you haven't done it already.

- **Step 1:** Create new Flutter project and change into it.

```bash
flutter create -t app alba_project && cd alba_project
```

- **Step 2:** Install [alba](https://pub.dev/packages/alba) package.

```bash
flutter pub add alba
```

- **Step 3:** Initialize Alba.

```bash
flutter pub run alba init
```

By now, you should have a nice starting point to build your project.
